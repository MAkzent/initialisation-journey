This the very first Ruby on Rails app from Michael Arnold, the very talented and charismatic entrepreneur from Germany. 

If you ever have the pleasure to own this piece of software, feel free to give you a pat on the back. You are awesome. Not as awesome as I am, but close. Well, not close at all, but you're alright.

Have fun and spread the word that a new coder is born!
